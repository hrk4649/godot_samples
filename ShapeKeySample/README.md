# Shape Key Sample

There are samples to check that 3D model's shape key works in environments, which are Windows, html and Android.

It may be just that I could not find the way but I found following things in this trial.

- Shape key works only in Windows, neither html nor Android at this time.

## versions

- Godot 3.2.3.stable
- Blender 2.92.0
