# Shape Key Sample

There are samples to check that 3D model's shape key works in environments, which are Windows, html(exported) and Android(exported).

It seems that Shape key works only in Windows,
and I could not find how to work shape key in html or Android at this time.

## versions

- Godot 3.2.3.stable
- Blender 2.92.0
