## Preparing video file that Godot can play

A video file must be converted to .webm or .ogv. if the file is not these format.
When to use ffmpeg to convert .mp4 file to .webm, type ```ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.webm```.
I could not convert .mp4 to .ogv correctly but it can be played on Godot.

## Environment

- Godot v3.4.2
- Windows 11
